# Face-Skin-disease
Face Skin disease detection comparison using CNN, CNN-LSTM, and Mobilenet
To classify face skin diseases such as The categories including Acne, Actinic keratosis, 
basal cell, Lupus-Chronic-Cutaneous, Rosacea, Seborrheic, squamous cell - Neural Network
 such as CNN was implemented. One hot encoding implemented to classify
 each of the class from 0-5. To compare these models performance, pre-trained Mobilenet
 was used.CNN model got train accuracy  97% and the  test accuracy is 82%. 
In contrast, Mobilenet Version - 2 has  train accuracy 93% while the test accuracy is 78%.
Proposed CNN model has outperformed the pre-trained mobilenet model.
